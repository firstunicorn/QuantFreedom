# Tutorials 

You will find tutorials here on various subjects ... please select from the menu on the left.

In most if not all of my links you will see three sections. One will be the offical documentaion link. Second will be the link to a youtube video i made explaining the subject. Third will be a couple of links to written tutorials.

The reason I am doing it this way is because there is no need to reinvent the wheel. There are plenty of people who haven written great blog posts on the basics of how to use the function. For me it is more important to make the youtube video because in there i will be going over specific things that i use the function for. In my opinion it is easier to learn from a video about the specifics and the written is better for just a quick refreasher on remembering a paramater or argument the function takes. So that is why i provide both as a solution. 

## Numpy Tutorials
Here i will be going over numpy tutorials based on the numpy functions i am mainly using in my project or my daily coding. You should get real familiar with the numpy documentation and how to search there. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html
