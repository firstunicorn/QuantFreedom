# Getting Started

## What is QuantFreedom?

So I chose to make this back tester because I saw that all of the backtesters out there they're either behind a paywall or they have people that aren't traders that are trying to build a platform for Traders. When I tried using the other backtesters and the documentation was absolutely trash or the people didn't want to talk to you or add certain features or the project is completely dead. So I realize that I'm just going to have to make my own which in the long run is actually good for me because it forces me to learn how to become a well-rounded complete from the ground up quant trader.

I also needed this thing to be ultra fast and the one place that I was using before was so slow that it was 100 times slower than the slowest back tester that's out there and the one that was the fastest the person just was not a traitor and had no interest in actually making a platform for Traders and so this is my combination of both of those and what I believe both of those platforms should have been

## Why QuantFreedom?
You should choose this back tester because of the fact that I'm here making this thing for the community we are making this thing for the community. the whole point of building this is to be able to build a community of like-minded individuals that share the passion for helping others while also making tons and tons of passive income. the whole goal of this is purely Community Driven mixed with the fastest speed of back testing and the best documentation that's out there.


## How it works

If you want to know how it works then I highly suggest you follow all of my YouTube channels and join the Discord or the telegram and look at the tutorial section on this website. if you do all of those you will be able to learn how the entire thing works but if you're looking to understand the inner workings well then it goes like this. at its core everything is based on numba when I can because when using numba it compiles extremely stupidly fast and that's what we all need. and so you basically download your data then you provide some indicators and then you evaluate those indicators to give you some signals and then you plug those signals into the back tester and it spits out the answer as far as if you were to use specific settings you would have made x amount of money
